# LiveCue

**LiveCue** is an AI-powered contextual assistant designed to support you in high-stakes conversations—whether you're in a meeting, interview, or client call. It processes multiple input types (audio, screenshots, raw text, etc.) in real time and delivers actionable cues, answers, or summaries—right when you need them.

## Customization Possibilities

The codebase is designed to be adaptable:

- **AI Models**: Though currently using OpenAI's models, you can modify the code to integrate with other providers like Claude, Deepseek, Llama, or any model with an API. All integration code is in `electron/ProcessingHelper.ts` and UI settings are in `src/components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`.
- **Languages**: Add support for additional programming languages
- **Features**: Extend the functionality with new capabilities
- **UI**: Customize the interface to your preferences

All it takes is modest JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge and understanding of the API you want to integrate.

## Features

- Mac OS native screen _recording_ (Command + Shift + 5)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or bun package manager
- OpenAI API Key
- Screen Recording Permission for Terminal/IDE
  - On macOS:
    1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording
    2. Ensure that LiveCue has screen recording permission enabled
    3. Restart CodeInterviewAssist after enabling permissions
  - On Windows:
    - No additional permissions needed
  - On Linux:
    - May require `xhost` access depending on your distribution

## Running the Application

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greeneu/livecue.git
cd livecue
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **RECOMMENDED**: Clean any previous builds:

```bash
npm run clean
```

4. Run the appropriate script for your platform:

**For Windows:**

```bash
stealth-run.bat
```

**For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
# Make the script executable first
chmod +x stealth-run.sh
./stealth-run.sh
```

**IMPORTANT**: The application window will be invisible by default! Use Ctrl+B (or Cmd+B on Mac) to toggle visibility.

### Building Distributable Packages

To create installable packages for distribution:

**For macOS (DMG):**

```bash
# Using npm
npm run package-mac

# Or using yarn
yarn package-mac
```

**For Windows (Installer):**

```bash
# Using npm
npm run package-win

# Or using yarn
yarn package-win
```

The packaged applications will be available in the `release` directory.

**What the scripts do:**

- Create necessary directories for the application
- Clean previous builds to ensure a fresh start
- Build the application in production mode
- Launch the application in invisible mode

### Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Window Manager Compatibility**: Some window management tools (like Rectangle Pro on macOS) may interfere with the app's window movement. Consider disabling them temporarily.

- **API Usage**: Be mindful of your OpenAI API key's rate limits and credit usage. Vision API calls are more expensive than text-only calls.

- **LLM Customization**: You can easily customize the app to include LLMs like Claude, Deepseek, or Grok by modifying the API calls in `ProcessingHelper.ts` and related UI components.

- **Common Issues**:
  - Run `npm run clean` before starting the app for a fresh build
  - Use Ctrl+B/Cmd+B multiple times if the window doesn't appear
  - Adjust window opacity with Ctrl+[/]/Cmd+[/] if needed
  - For macOS: ensure script has execute permissions (`chmod +x stealth-run.sh`)

- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI Components
- OpenAI API

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Launch the invisible window
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the settings
   - Choose your preferred model for extraction, solution generation, and debugging

2. **Capturing Problem**
   - Use global shortcut [Control or Cmd + H] to take screenshots of code problems
   - Screenshots are automatically added to the queue of up to 2
   - If needed, remove the last screenshot with [Control or Cmd + L]

3. **Processing**
   - Press [Control or Cmd + Enter] to analyze the screenshots
   - AI extracts problem requirements from the screenshots using GPT-4 Vision API
   - The model generates an optimal solution based on the extracted information
   - All analysis is done using your personal OpenAI API key

4. **Solution & Debugging**
   - View the generated solutions with detailed explanations
   - Use debugging feature by taking more screenshots of error messages or code
   - Get structured analysis with identified issues, corrections, and optimizations
   - Toggle between solutions and queue views as needed

5. **Window Management**
   - Move window using [Control or Cmd + Arrow keys]
   - Toggle visibility with [Control or Cmd + B]
   - Adjust opacity with [Control or Cmd + [] and [Control or Cmd + ]]
   - Window remains invisible to specified screen sharing applications
   - Start a new problem using [Control or Cmd + R]

6. **Language Selection

   - Easily switch between programming languages with a single click
   - Use arrow keys for keyboard navigation through available languages
   - The system dynamically adapts to any languages added or removed from the codebase
   - Your language preference is saved between sessions

## Adding More AI Models

This application is built with extensibility in mind. You can easily add support for additional LLMs alongside the existing OpenAI integration:

- You can add Claude, Deepseek, Grok, or any other AI model as alternative options
- The application architecture allows for multiple LLM backends to coexist
- Users can have the freedom to choose their preferred AI provider

To add new models, simply extend the API integration in `electron/ProcessingHelper.ts` and add the corresponding UI options in `src/components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`. The modular design makes this straightforward without disrupting existing functionality.

## Configuration

### API Keys and Model Selection

You can configure API keys and models in two ways:

1. **Environment Variables** (recommended for security)
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example` for reference)
   - Available variables:
     - API Keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
     - Models: `EXTRACTION_MODEL`, `SOLUTION_MODEL`, `DEBUGGING_MODEL`
     - Language: `LANGUAGE`

2. **Config File** (backward compatible)
   - Your personal API key is stored locally and only used for API calls to the respective provider
   - Settings are stored at: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\livecue\config.json` (Windows) or `/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/livecue/config.json` (macOS)

Environment variables take precedence over the config file when both are present.

### Other Settings

- **Model Selection**: You can choose between different models for each stage of processing:
  - Problem Extraction: Analyzes screenshots to understand the coding problem
  - Solution Generation: Creates optimized solutions with explanations
  - Debugging: Provides detailed analysis of errors and improvement suggestions
- **Language**: Select your preferred programming language for solutions
- **Window Controls**: Adjust opacity, position, and zoom level using keyboard shortcuts
- **All settings are stored locally** in your user data directory and persist between sessions
